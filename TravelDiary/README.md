**Creating and editing a personal diary:**

Writing about what happened every day or during trips, adding photos, recording locations of restaurants, museums and more.
The content of each blog can be customized to meet the personal preference of a user. 

**Blogs will be organized and presented to users in different ways:**
1. Calendar view: The interface resembles the iOS default calendar application. When a user taps a specific date, the corresponding blog, if exists, will appear in full screen.
2. Table view: A list of all blogs created by the user. The sections will be generated according to the user-defined categories.
3. Map view: This view will present a map that contains all the blogs in the form of map annotations. Tapping on each pin will bring up the corresponding blog.
